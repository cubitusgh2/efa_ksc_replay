         * During "showing" the efaBths frame, a lot of GUI and background tasks are initialized.
         * Unfortunately, some of the background tasks try to update the GUI.
         * So there are at least three threads which are running in parallel:
         * - this thread of main program, where most of the initialization takes place
         * - AWT Thread for swing (not thread safe)
         * - background task(s) which tries to update the GUI.
         * 
         * This leads to problems during startup. 
         * - MetalLookAndFeel seems mostly stable, as it is very lightweight. 
         * - NimbusLookAndFeel as a Synth look&feel is a bit heavier, meaning it takes longer  
         *   for the controls to repaint. Every 30th restart of efa on a raspberry pi 3b leads to an exception in Nimbus LAF.
         * - efaFlatLaf is very prone to problems during startup, as it does a lot of threading itself.
         *   Every fifth startup of efa on a rasperry pi 3b makes efaBths hang during the initialisation of efaBaseFrame.
         *   It simply does not show up.
         *   
         * Other threads have been updated in the past to do thread-safe calls to update swing components
         * (via SwingUtilities.invokelater).
         * 
         * So this main thread as well needs to update swing components in a thread-safe way.
         * This is done by SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait, so that the splash screen gets invisible _after_
         * showing the efaBths main window. InvokeAndWait is okay, as any other functions which try to update
         * GUI use invokelater() which avoids deadlocks between different tasks.
